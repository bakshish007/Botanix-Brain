# Botanix Brain

Botanix Brain is an innovative project that addresses challenges faced by farmers and gardeners through a combination of hardware and software solutions. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as AI, ML, and data science, this project aims to guide users in selecting the most suitable plants for their specific location.

## Project Overview

The system employs a blend of soil and climate sensors to gather environmental data, including soil pH, temperature, humidity, sunlight exposure, and moisture levels. Using AI/ML algorithms, the software analyzes this data and compares it with an extensive database of information on various fruits and plants.

## Key Features

1. **Intelligent Recommendations:** The system provides personalized plant recommendations based on thorough analysis, considering factors crucial for plant growth.
2. **Informative Dashboard:** A user-friendly dashboard assists users in interpreting data received from sensors and facilitates predictions through an interactive UI.
3. **Accurate Dataset:** A meticulously crafted dataset of over 1500 records, created under the guidance of agricultural experts, ensures accurate predictions and reliable recommendations.

## Hardware and Software

- **Hardware:** Arduino, Soil and climate sensors (Sunlight, Moisture, Temperature, Humidity, Air Quality)
- **Software:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Plotly, Tkinter, Matplotlib, Custom Tkinter
